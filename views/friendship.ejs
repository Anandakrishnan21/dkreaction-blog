      Friendship, a precious bond acquired throughout one's lifetime, holds the
      power to cultivate love, sharing, trust, and support. While our lives
      intersect with numerous individuals, true friendship is forged with only a
      select few. In each phase of life, we encounter many acquaintances, but it
      is the friend who stands by our side in times of need who proves their
      authenticity. Trustworthiness, helpfulness, and genuine love are the
      fundamental qualities of a good friend.

      Parents, our initial and greatest companions, enter our lives from the
      moment they lay eyes on us. They impart upon us the significance of
      friendship and teach us how to discern genuine companions. Throughout
      school and college, we form connections with many peers. Some remain
      steadfast while others drift away. However, during moments of failure and
      adversity, true friends provide unwavering support and serve as pillars of
      strength.

      When faced with urgent financial requirements, our thoughts instinctively
      turn to our friends. This inclination stems from the deep love and trust
      we have for them. Nonetheless, not all friendships withstand the test of
      time, often due to a loss of trust. On occasion, our friends may even
      become our life partners, demonstrating that friendships have the
      potential to evolve into profound relationships.

      Real friendship is not exclusive to humans; it can be observed among all
      living beings. This truth became apparent within the confines of my own
      home. We have three hens that share an extraordinary bond. Regrettably,
      during our absence, a dog attacked them. One hen perished instantly,
      another suffered severe wounds, and the remaining one managed to escape
      unscathed. Upon returning home that night, we discovered the lifeless hen
      and assumed the worst for the others. However, to our astonishment, we
      witnessed the unwounded hen faithfully standing beside the highly wounded
      one throughout the entire night. In that moment, I truly comprehended the
      power of friendship and realized that friendship exists not solely among
      humans but among all creatures.
